//
//    The most efficient way to display a character is to make use of the "wrap-around" feature
//    of the Philips PCF8833 LCD controller chip.
//
//    Assume that we position the character at (20, 20) that's a (row, col) specification.
//    With the row and column address set commands, you can specify an 8x8 box for the SMALL and MEDIUM
//    characters or a 16x8 box for the LARGE characters.
//
//                   WriteSpiCommand(PASET);                // set the row drawing limits
//                   WriteSpiData(20);                      //
//                   WriteSpiData(27);                      // limit rows to (20, 27)
//
//                   WriteSpiCommand(CASET);                // set the column drawing limits
//                   WriteSpiData(20);                      //
//                   WriteSpiData(27);                      // limit columns to (20,27)
//
//    When the algorithm completes col 27, the column address wraps back to 20
//    At the same time, the row address increases by one (this is done by the controller)
//
//    We walk through each row, two pixels at a time. The purpose is to create three
//    data bytes representing these two pixels in the following format (as specified by Philips
//    for RGB 4 : 4 : 4 format (see page 62 of PCF8833 controller manual).
//
//                   Data for pixel 0:   RRRRGGGGBBBB
//                   Data for Pixel 1:   RRRRGGGGBBBB
//
//                   WriteSpiCommand(RAMWR);                // start a memory write (96 data bytes to follow)
//
//                   WriteSpiData(RRRRGGGG);                // first pixel, red and green data
//                   WriteSpiData(BBBBRRRR);                // first pixel, blue data; second pixel, red data
//                   WriteSpiData(GGGGBBBB);                // second pixel, green and blue data
//                           :
//    and so on until all pixels displayed!
//                           :
//                   WriteSpiCommand(NOP);                  // this will terminate the RAMWR command
